Work through LIGO signal processing tutorial (Hayley and Nathan)
Grab hdf5 files from LIGO (Josey)
Compare H1 data to L1 (can we break this up into smaller tasks?)
	To do this comparison, make a SNR cut
	Watch out for injections
	Steps/subtasks:
		read in data file
		calculate signal/noise ratio (SNR)
		make signal/noise cut
		compare two detectors
		output events (high SNR) that take place at the same time in both detectors
