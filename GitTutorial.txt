Getting started with Git:
1. install git
2. open terminal (or command line on Windows)
3. Use the following lines to set up git
	$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	$ git config --global user.email "youremail@somewhere.com"
4. If you enter $ git config -l then the variables you just set should show up

Cloning our repo:
1. Cloning is the initial copying of the repository down to your computer
2. Open terminal
3. cd to the directory where you want these files to be
4. Use the following line
	$ git clone https://github.com/joseyhanish/LigoProject.git

Pulling from the repo:
1. Before every time you start working, you should pull changes from the repo (copy the changes from the server copy of the code to your local copy of the code)
2. open terminal
3. cd to the directory where you put the repo
4. Use the following line to pull
	$ git pull

Pushing your changes to the repo:
1. Every time you finish working, you should push your changes to the repo so the rest of us can see the up-to-date code.
2. Open terminal 
3. cd to the directory where you put the repo
4. Use the following lines *in this order*
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "your message here"
	$ git push
5. Explanation:
	git add . creates a snapshot of each file
	git commit permanently adds the snapshots to version history
	Your commit message should be a brief note about changes you made
	It is important to specify a commit message using the -m option, or else you will get stuck in VIM! (see below)
	git push sends your commit to the server

If you get stuck in VIM:
1. Press i to turn VIM to insert mode
2. Type your message
3. Press esc to turn VIM to command mode
4. Press :wq to save and quit
